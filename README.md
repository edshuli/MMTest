### **Front End**

<a href="https://dev.w3.org/html5/html-author/"> **HTML 5** </a> : Markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web.

<a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/Email.html"> **CSS 3** </a>: Style the web documents

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">**JavaScript**</a>: used to program the behavior of Web pages.


## Testing
<hr>

I was testing the application manual throughout the process of it.
I used mainly <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/">**DEVTOOLS**</a> for my testing. The site was tested on many browser like ( Google Chrome,
Internet Explorer, Safari and Opera ) and mobile devices such as Iphone8,6s, Huaweii P20 Lite, Samsung Galaxy S10, Samsung Galaxy A20 (Chrome, Ipad, Safari) to ensure compatibility and responsiveness.

The screen sizes tested on decision are the below:

* Moto G4 (360 x 640)
* Galaxy S5 (360 x 640)
* Pixel 2  (411 x 731)
* Pixel 2XL (411 x 823)
* iPhone 5/SE (320 x 568)
* iPhone 6/7/8 (375 x 667)
* iPhone 6/7/8 Plus (414 x 736)
* iPhone X (375 x 812)
* iPad (768 x 1024)
* iPad Pro (1024 x 1366)
* Desktop (xl screens)

To validate the HTML code I used <a href="https://validator.w3.org/"> The W3C Markup Validation Service </a> and 
<a href="https://htmlformatter.com/"> HTML Formatter</a> to use the correct format of HTML5. Showed few errors but that is mainly because of the links that we used due to Python and Flask. But the links work perfectly.

To validate CSS 3 code I used <a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/Email.html"> The CSS Validation Service </a>. The validation showed no error and the connection with Bootstrap was very good.
